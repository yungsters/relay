But the implementation is often much more complex. Imperative approaches require us to implement all of those steps: reach into the UI and toggle the button, initiate a network request, retry it if necessary, show an error if it fails (and untoggle the button), etc. The same goes for data-fetching: specifying ',Object(i.b)("em",{parentName:"p"},"what")," data we need often dictates ",Object(i.b)("em",{parentName:"p"},"how")," and ",Object(i.b)("em",{parentName:"p"},"when")," it is fetched. Next, we'll explore our approach to solving these concerns with ",Object(i.b)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Relay"),"."))}h.isMDXComponent=!0},323:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.d(t,"a",(function(){return p})),a.d(t,"b",(function(){return b}));var n=a(0),r=a.n(n);function i(e,t,a){return t in e?Object.defineProperty(e,t,{value:a,enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0}):e[t]=a,e}function o(e,t){var a=Object.keys(e);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var n=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);t&&(n=n.filter((function(t){return Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(e,t).enumerable}))),a.push.apply(a,n)}return a}function s(e){for(var t=1;t<arguments.length;t++){var a=null!=arguments[t]?arguments[t]:{};t%2?o(Object(a),!0).forEach((function(t){i(e,t,a[t])})):Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors?Object.defineProperties(e,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(a)):o(Object(a)).forEach((function(t){Object.defineProperty(e,t,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(a,t))}))}return e}function c(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var a,n,r=function(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var a,n,r={},i=Object.keys(e);for(n=0;n<i.length;n++)a=i[n],t.indexOf(a)>=0||(r[a]=e[a]);return r}(e,t);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var i=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);for(n=0;n<i.length;n++)a=i[n],t.indexOf(a)>=0||Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(e,a)&&(r[a]=e[a])}return r}var l=r.a.createContext({}),h=function(e){var t=r.a.useContext(l),a=t;return e&&(a="function"==typeof e?e(t):s(s({},t),e)),a},p=function(e){var t=h(e.components);return r.a.createElement(l.Provider,{value:t},e.children)},d={inlineCode:"code",wrapper:function(e){var t=e.children;return r.a.createElement(r.a.Fragment,{},t)}},u=r.a.forwardRef((function(e,t){var a=e.components,n=e.mdxType,i=e.originalType,o=e.parentName,l=c(e,["components","mdxType","originalType","parentName"]),p=h(a),u=n,b=p["".concat(o,".").concat(u)]||p[u]||d[u]||i;return a?r.a.createElement(b,s(s({ref:t},l),{},{components:a})):r.a.createElement(b,s({ref:t},l))}));function b(e,t){var a=arguments,n=t&&t.mdxType;if("string"==typeof e||n){var i=a.length,o=new Array(i);o[0]=u;var s={};for(var c in t)hasOwnProperty.call(t,c)&&(s[c]=t[c]);s.originalType=e,s.mdxType="string"==typeof e?e:n,o[1]=s;for(var l=2;l<i;l++)o[l]=a[l];return r.a.createElement.apply(null,o)}return r.a.createElement.apply(null,a)}u.displayName="MDXCreateElement"}}]);
